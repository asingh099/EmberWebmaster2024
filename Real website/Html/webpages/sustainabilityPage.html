                    It is where we source all our food. Upstate, we own 
                    pastures containing acres of 
                    free-grazing land for our cows, as well as calamansi trees that blossom and bear 
                    fruit year-round. In the summer, palm trees bear coconuts, which we use in many 
                    dishes, especially desserts! Our hens also reside here in our pastures, with ample 
                    coops for laying eggs. Our land is healthy and taken care of daily with compost 
                    that provides nutrients to all of our livestock and fruit trees.

                <p class="slide-text">Our farm location in upstate New York utilizes greenhouses 
                    and hydroponics to optimize space and other natural resources. We grow most of our fresh 
                    produce indoors year-round by using vertical hydroponic technology, which uses 99% 
                    less land and 98% less water compared to traditional farming techniques. Our year-round 
                    operation also ensures a consistent harvest and a crop yield 240 times more than conventional
                    farms. Additionally, farming indoors keeps our plants shielded from pests, so we don't need 
                    to use chemical pesticides.

                <p class="slide-text">Agriculture and the food supply chain account for between 
                    21% and 37% of our planet's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Our farm's proximity 
                    to our restaurant cuts down our carbon footprint by avoiding long-distance 
                    transportation and shipping. This closeness also allows us to serve our 
                    customers the freshest food without the need for long-term preservation. 
                    We emphasize a green 
                    operation by running our kitchens off solar and wind energy, as well as 
                    having plants all around the dining area, creating a perfect environment 
                    for eating. Additionally, our staff works tirelessly to minimize food waste 
                    by composting food scraps, which are then brought back to our farm.

                <p class="slide-text">Embêr promotes sustainability. At our restaurant, food waste is 
                    collected and separated; dairy waste is disposed of, while vegetable waste is thrown 
                    into bins and taken back to our farms. This vegetable waste is then allowed to decompose 
                    over time, becoming compost rich in nutrients. The compost made at our farm is subsequently
                     applied to the soil used in our farms and greenhouses. As a result, the nutrient-rich 
                     compost enables us to grow the necessary vegetables needed for our restaurant, as well 
                     as the crops used to feed our livestock!

                At Ember, we strive to give our customers the best taste, starting with how our food 
                is prepared. While we are a fusion restaurant focused on innovative taste, we still 
                want each dish to embody what came before it. We use traditional cooking techniques and 
                ingredients to ensure that our dishes maintain bits of identity from the cuisines we 
                fuse. For example, woks and grills are utilized for stir-frying. Dumplings and Dim Sum 
                are prepared by hand to ensure quality. 
            </p>
            <p class="prep-paragraph2">
                For our cutlery and cooking utensils, everything is reusable. Each item is also hand-washed 
                by our staff, whose goal is always sanitation. As per New York City Regulations, we always 
                follow the necessary sanitary processes to ensure our food does not spread harmful bacteria 
                or diseases. Our equipment, such as woks and pans, is frequently washed. Specific pans are 
                also designated for allergens to ensure we avoid cross-contamination. With food hygiene 
                inspections every 6-12 months by the NYC Health Department, we can guarantee your food is 
                prepared with the highest sanitation standards.
