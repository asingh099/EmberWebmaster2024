                <h3 class="slide-caption">1. Our Pastures:</h3>
                <p class="slide-text"> Our farm, located in upstate New York just 30 miles from the city, is a self-sustaining system where we grow our fresh produce and raise our animals. The cows graze freely on open pastures, which keeps them healthy by allowing them to move naturally and live comfortably. This type of grazing also helps the environment by spreading manure and leftover produce across the land, adding nutrients to the soil. It supports stronger plant growth, helps soil microbes thrive, and even stores more carbon in the ground, making the land healthier over time. In addition to our pasture space, we grow a variety of fruit trees in climate-controlled greenhouses, which allow us to produce crops throughout the year. Studies show that greenhouse farming can improve food production by protecting plants from extreme weather and pests. During the warmer months, our tropical greenhouse supports calamansi trees and coconut trees, which are used in many of our desserts and signature dishes. Compared to traditional farming, greenhouses often use less land and fewer natural resources, making them a more sustainable option. Our farm also includes pasture-based systems for raising hens, with clean coops and outdoor areas for foraging. This setup helps maintain healthy chickens and better-quality eggs while allowing us to naturally manage food scraps. Staying committed to regenerative farming, we collect organic waste from our restaurant and turn it into compost. This compost is used throughout the farm to support plant growth and improve soil without relying on synthetic fertilizers. By recycling nutrients and keeping outside inputs low, we reduce our environmental impact and create a balanced system where animals, plants, and food waste all work together to support long-term sustainability.

                <h3 class="slide-caption">2. Innovative Growth:</h3>
                <p class="slide-text">Our farm in upstate New York uses advanced greenhouse and hydroponic systems to grow fresh produce efficiently and sustainably. By using vertical hydroponic technology, we reduce land use by up to 99% and water use by 98% compared to traditional farming methods. Hydroponics doesn’t rely on soil, so it avoids problems like erosion, tilling, and nutrient runoff. It helps protect natural land by lowering the need for chemicals and reducing pressure on soil-based farming, allowing surrounding ecosystems to stay healthier and giving overused farmland time to recover. Indoor farming also protects our crops from unpredictable weather, making year-round harvesting possible without delays caused by droughts, frost, or storms. Studies show that vertical farms can produce up to 240 times more food per acre, making them ideal for growing more food in less space. Our enclosed growing areas also keep pests out, which reduces the need for chemical pesticides and creates a cleaner, safer environment for both plants and people. By combining hydroponics with climate-controlled greenhouses, we grow high-quality food while using fewer natural resources, producing less waste, and lowering our environmental impact. In hydroponics, plants receive a carefully balanced mix of nutrients—like nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium—directly through the water, which leads to faster growth and higher crop yields. Because we can monitor and control these nutrients precisely, the produce is not only healthier but also grown with less waste. The controlled environment also lowers the risk of contamination, making hydroponic crops safer and more consistent. By reducing spoilage, runoff, and overuse of inputs, this method helps cut down on food waste across the entire system.

                <p class="slide-text">
                    Agriculture and the food supply chain contribute between 21% and 37% of global CO₂ emissions. By sourcing our ingredients directly from a farm located just 30 miles away, we significantly reduce the need for long-distance transportation. This helps us minimize fuel consumption, packaging waste, and refrigeration needs. We are also able to serve our customers fresh food that does not depend on energy-intensive preservation methods. Our staff also actively works to minimize food waste by collecting leftover produce and scraps, which are returned to the farm to be composted. This composting process not only keeps food out of landfills, where it would have released methane—a greenhouse gas over 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide—but also turns waste into something useful for the soil. By closing the loop between our restaurant and farm, we reduce emissions, limit waste, and contribute to a more balanced and environmentally responsible food system.

                <p class="slide-text">Embêr promotes sustainability. At our restaurant, food waste is 
                    collected and separated; dairy waste is disposed of, while vegetable waste is thrown 
                    into bins and taken back to our farms. This vegetable waste is then allowed to decompose 
                    over time, becoming compost rich in nutrients. The compost made at our farm is subsequently
                     applied to the soil used in our farms and greenhouses. As a result, the nutrient-rich 
                     compost enables us to grow the necessary vegetables needed for our restaurant, as well 
                     as the crops used to feed our livestock!

                At Embêr, we strive to give our customers the best taste, starting with how our food is prepared. While we are a fusion restaurant focused on innovative flavor, we still want each dish to reflect the traditions behind it. We use time-honored cooking techniques and ingredients to ensure our dishes carry the identity of the cuisines we draw from. For example, woks and grills are used for stir-frying, while bamboo steamers are used to prepare dumplings and dim sum entirely by hand to ensure quality and preserve authentic texture and flavor.

                We also prioritize sustainability in the kitchen. All of our cutlery and cooking utensils are reusable and carefully chosen to avoid single-use plastics. Every item is hand-washed by staff, who are trained to uphold high sanitation standards. As per New York City Regulations, we follow all required health protocols to prevent the spread of bacteria or foodborne illness. Equipment such as woks, pans, and cutting boards is washed frequently, and specific cookware is designated and labeled for allergen-free preparation. This helps prevent cross-contact with ingredients like dairy, nuts, gluten, and soy.

With food safety inspections conducted every 6 to 12 months by the NYC Health Department, we guarantee that our food is prepared under the highest health and hygiene standards. Whether it’s a small handmade dish or a large family-style plate, everything we serve is handled with care, tradition, and responsibility.
